# My CV Project

This is my personal CV and cover letter project, built using Typst and based on the Brilliant CV template.

## How to Build

Run the compile script to generate the PDF files:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

This will create `build/cv.pdf` and `build/letter.pdf`.

## Credits

This project is based on the [Brilliant CV](https://github.com/yunanwg/brilliant-CV) template by yunanwg. Thanks for the awesome work!
